1. List of filters that are all anded to be applied
1.5. Launch ncli pd ls-repl-status, Capture output get meta op ID, look for PD name
     Launch allssh "cd data/logs;grep <filename> * --include stargate*;" Capture output
     Parse out the IP address that responded with anything
1.6 Filter, apply contains(col_name,streing);

2. JOIN operator
     i. Change mop_history table to be map<string,map<string,vector<string>>>
        Change completed_mop to this as well, 
   --mop_history, --completed_mop --join_type=simple, left, right 
DONE 3. READ multiple cerebro.* files or all cerebro files in folder non zipped
DONE 4. Cross reference stargate logs for files
DONE     allssh grep file name and count returned number of lines for each IP address, Guess that the IP that is replicating by number of grep hits
5. PARSE ReceiveMetaop
   ChangeMode
   ChangeStretchMode
6. CrashLoop? Which meta op to kill to get out of loop

7. FILTER type LESS_THAN< GREATER_THAN,
==================================================
To do
1. Time stamp filter
2. Filter for Joins, Column list for Joins
3. Multiple filters comma separated - Done
4. Change completed meta op parser AddToMap to be like the rest - Done
5. SCHEMA - return all attributes - Done
6. HARDEN EVERYTHING
7. Exception safety, crash safty null checks
7.5. ONCALL 1179 - STUCK REPLICATION
    FIND THE VDISK THAT IS STUCK - ON MASTER - MOP_HISTORY table find latest MOP that has NOT completed
    FIND NODE THAT IS REPLICATING THE VDISK - Get VDISK ID, File names for ALL the replicating files, and related replicating node
    FIND OUT IF THERE AREA ANY STARGATE ERRORS on THAT REPLICATING NODE- load ERRORs and FATALs on stargate on the replicAting node : remote not available yet

8. JSON parser definition - Input should be a json file that has attrs like
file type, File Name regex, Pattern that matches a line, attribute names that should be parsed out

REMOTE SERVERS RUNNING ON ALL NODES
MASTER node where the py client is,
REMOTE JOIN, REMOTE Query

OPTIMIZATION
To be able to delete records fpr mem cap reasons
MVCC model to be consistent in reading data
Thread the loading?



IDEALLY scenario
Cerebro problem, crash loop something
start servers 
Run a query
status() = Gets latest error
Get PD for error
Get snap for error
Get OpCode for error
Get Meta op Id to abort
ABORT the meta op


deduped in memory tables?
